### 1.1.0 / 2014-03-02

Enhancements:

* Allow Time, Date and DateTime to be coerced into Shokkenki terms
* Only show shokkenki-consumer lines in RSpec backtrace
* Create an interaction label from request method, path, query and headers if none is given

Bug Fixes:

* Interactions with the same label now overwrite each other - avoids duplicate interactions

Bug Fixes:

* Orders can now refer to the calling context. Lazily evaluated RSpec 'lets' were not working before (thanks @gabrielrotbart)

### 1.0.0 / 2014-02-24

* Initial release - allow tickets to be generated by a consumer

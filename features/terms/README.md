Shokkenki terms are criteria used by a consumer to describe parts of a request or response.

**Terms define criteria**. Terms can be used by a prover stub to match incoming requests or by an acutal provider and its tests to ensure that a response is as the consumer expects.

**Terms have examples**. An example can be generated for each term and a stubbed provider uses these examples when generating a response.

Some terms are composable; they can contain other terms and form complex expressions. They are designed to allow a consumer to specify only what it cares about.

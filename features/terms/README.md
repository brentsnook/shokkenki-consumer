Shokkenki terms are used to describe parts of a request or response. They are defined by a consumer as criteria for matching a request or specifying what it expects in a response.

Terms can be used in consumer tests to generate example responses or in provider tests to ensure that a particular reponse adheres to the contract laid out by the consumer.

Some terms are composable; they can contain other terms and form complex expressions. They are designed to allow a consumer to specify only what it cares about.
